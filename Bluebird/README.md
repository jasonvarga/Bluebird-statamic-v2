BlueBird is a Twitter API 1.1 plugin for the Statamic CMS v2.x. With BlueBird, you can pull down a predefined number of tweets from any user with publicly available tweets. BlueBird automatically coverts hashtags, URLs, and mentions into their appropriate links. 

To get started, simply upload the folders to the appropriate directories. If you haven't registered for a Twitter API, you may [do so here](http://dev.twitter.com). After you obtain your Access Token, Access Token Secret, Consumer Key, and Consumer Secret, add them to "/site/addons/Bluebird/default.yaml". That's it!

### Support
